# typestill

A commonplace notebook built on top of Excalidraw. Fixed-size pages, one after the other, in one file. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the product spec, data model and phases.

Status: Phases 1 and 2 are done (lined and zine pages, one infinite canvas per notebook, media pool, themes, tags, spreads, IndexedDB storage, backups); Phase 3 (search, exports, the shelf) is under way.

## Development

Requires Node 22+ and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install   # also copies Excalidraw's fonts into public/fonts
pnpm dev       # http://localhost:5173
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```
